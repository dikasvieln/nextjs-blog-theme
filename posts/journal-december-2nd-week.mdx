Let me share to you about what do I do in 1st week of December, It's about create documentation for C1 Kafka apps which is may the most complicated apps that I've been through. Kafka itself was built on supporting and also managing the products catalogue stream on myXL. After that, the journey continue with making the new diagrams for C1 kafka.

## What do I do
For the documentation, I've walkthrough with some interview the BE teams who get involved on the C1 kafka. The flow was unexpectedly complex, and the diagrams itself especially the sequence diagrams took me about 1 day to re-image the pattern.

## The blocker 
I think it's almost no blocker. Because all the teams who got involved was dedicated to get the documentation ready to send to the client side.

## The Next 
I still waiting for getting reply from the client.

## Conclusion
I hope and the team expect for the documentation that I write was accepted without any revision. Eventhough, there is any concern about the content, It should be an updated version of the documentation. 

Thank you for reading my journal. GBU
