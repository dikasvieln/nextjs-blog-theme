Let me share with you what do I do in 1st week of December, It's about to create documentation for C1 Kafka apps which is may the most complicated apps that I've been through. Kafka itself was built on supporting and also managing the products catalog stream on myXL. After that, the journey continues with making the new diagrams for C1 Kafka.

## What do I do
For the documentation, I've walkthrough with some interviews with the BE teams who get involved in the C1 Kafka. The flow was unexpectedly complex, and the diagrams themselves especially the sequence diagrams took me about 1 day to re-image the pattern.

## The blocker 
I think it's almost no blocker. Because all the teams who got involved were dedicated to getting the documentation ready to send to the client side.

## The Next 
I'm still wait for getting a reply from the client.

## Conclusion
I hope the team expects for the documentation that I write was accepted without any revision. Even though, there is any concern about the content, It should be an updated version of the documentation.

Thank you for reading my journal. GBU
