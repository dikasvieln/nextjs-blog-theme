## intro
When we first initiate or starting the project for making the apps or webapps, an experience developer often use CLI (Command Line Interface).
CLI means Command Line Interface. If you want to be experiance developer I recommend to use CLI to start a new project or making a new feature. 

One of them is OCLIF. OCLIF stand for Open Code Life Cycle Framework.
When you first time using OCLIF, you might to know how system processing in CLI. The system will firstly parse the command line arguments. Then it will check the command name. If the command name is correct, it will check the command arguments. And If the command arguments are correct for another option, it will execute the command.

## OCLIF CLI
The OCLIf was provided a customize cli for FE Dev. It was a lot of feature in it. There are example that are using OCLIF is Svelte-kit, Heroku, and etc. All you need is LTS Nodejs version that has been installed inside your PC.
In OCLIF everything is customizeable, you can arrange your command interface into list of optional command or even customize your own helper generation. Like the slogan of CLI means, It's a platform to build upon that provides smart defaults without locking you into any specific tools or behavior.

## OCLIF Feature
- Flag/Argument parsing  
None of the CLI framework can't work without flag parser. The custom flag that built by OCLIF was a result of experiments that we feel consistently handles user input flexible enough.
- Configurable Topic Separator  
The OCLIF built in with customize separator command which is by default the topic commands will be separated with colons. But however, you have option to use spaces if you prefer. by example 
```
mycommand init another-command
```
- Super Speed cli  
The speed of OCLIF when we run the command almost nothing. It's because the cli itself required a few dependency. So, even there is a lot of command that generated it should be the same as a single command generate. 
- Testing Helper  
One of unique feature with OCLIF was the commands will generate a testing helper automatically.

## Rustvelt
From the OCLIF, I built practical cli as an example and the source [https://github.com/AulsD/cli-rustvelt](source)
The repos contains a cli to generate FE starter kit which is will reproduce bunch of list package and mix up folder between rust and svelte kit. 
May in the future, there is an update feature which implement rust with react or vue. 
data
rustvelt cli list of package:
- enquirer
- express
- oclif
- @oclif/command
- @oclif/config
- @oclif/plugin-help
- cosmiconfig
- debug
- globby
- jest
- jest-dir
- tslib
- @oclif/dev-cli
- @oclif/test
- @types/jest
- @types/node
- ts-node
- typescript

## How to use rustvelt CLI
The first things to do make sure that you have already installed a new version of NodeJS. 
And you should follow along below commands: 
```
npm -g i rustvelt
npx rustvelt 
```

You'll prompt out the cli with a statements 
```
What is your folder name?
```

It will asking about your customize boilerplate FE cli. 

## Conclusion
OCLIF (open code life cycle framework) was one of many cli generator that makes developer easily to use and to create a system customizeable command line interface. Which is makes your custom CLI more robust to build an extensive cli. I hope this article makes you gain more knowledgement about what is command line interface. If there is any bad grammar or bad sentences that not correctly feels right to you. Please give me an advice or any suggestion. I'm available for anytime to heard it from you.
