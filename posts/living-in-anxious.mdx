## Preface
The term of anxious can be various, in my case I do feel lack of awareness while I'm facing new environment or situation that makes me not comfortable, such as meet a new people. And that is why in my opinion state of anxiety might be part of mental illness. Especially in a new working environment, state of anxious can a be much more when I didn't know how to handle it. 

The anxious has the most affecting over 30% adult and sometime comes with a negative thought of mind. That torturous of negative think pushes over even more anxiety state and also can cause physical reactions. Moreover, living with anxiety most of it are lonely and isolate person. As one who have been suffer from it says "it's not visible, people don't understand it and too often think willpower can make it go away" 

## How to manage
It's long-term disease and no doubt about it. Because we need to learn self-aware of our mental ilness, even though that any other person doesn't know about our actually mental health condition. In that state, sometime can be life-safer. It's an evolutionary trait meant to protect us from kind of any dangerous that approach us. 

Based on others experiment, the standard for anxiety disorder treatment are these kind below:
- CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), 
- Dialectical Behavioral Therapy
- Exposure Therapy
- Medication

## Conclusion
With the right kind of treatment, it might cool down your anxiety level. And based of my experience, anxious state could be a sign of warning situation that might be helpful to you. So, in case makes you worried, you should think that as positive vibe first before decide that your anxiety state can become negative thought of yourself.
