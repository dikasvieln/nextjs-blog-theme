## Preface
The term anxious can be various, in my case I do feel a lack of awareness while I'm facing a new environment or situation that makes me not comfortable, such as meeting new people. And that is why in my opinion state of anxiety might be part of mental illness. Especially in a new working environment, a state of anxiety can be much more when I didn't know how to handle it.

The anxious has the most affecting over 30% of adults and sometimes comes with a negative thought of mind. That torturous of negative thinking push over even more anxiety state and also can cause physical reactions. Moreover, those living with anxiety most of it are a lonely and isolated person. As one who have been suffer from it says "it's not visible, people don't understand it and too often think willpower can make it go away"

## How to manage
It's a long-term disease and no doubt about it. Because we need to learn self-aware of our mental illness, even though that any other person doesn't know about our actually mental health condition. In that state, some time can be life-safer. It's an evolutionary trait meant to protect us from the kind of dangers that approach us.

Based on others experiment, the standard for anxiety disorder treatment are these kind below:
- CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), 
- Dialectical Behavioral Therapy
- Exposure Therapy
- Medication

## Conclusion
With the right kind of treatment, it might cool down your anxiety level. And based on my experience, the anxious state could be a sign of a warning situation that might be helpful to you. So, in the case that makes you worried, you should think of that as a positive vibe first before deciding that your anxiety state can become negative thought of yourself.
