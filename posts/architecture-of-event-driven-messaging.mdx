## Intro
Event Driven Messaging is actually a simple design pattern and many engineers out there use these to manage the flow of their data. The design pattern applied with the service-oriented paradigm enables the service consumer to stream event data within the service provider to get the notification data.

The interaction between a service consumer and a service provider can be initiated by the service consumer itself. To respond to an event that occurs within the boundary of the service consumer it should require some data from external sources. Event-Driven Architecture allows form more flexible, scalable, contextual, and responsive digital. An example of the event-driven arch which one of them is the Kafka engine.

## What is event streaming
Event streaming is the process of capturing data in the form of streams of events in real-time from event sources such as databases, IoT devices, or others
Kafka event-driven messaging

## Kafka event driven messaging
Kafka is a distributed event streaming that enables some applications to efficiently manage large amounts of data. It's fault-tolerant, high-scalability, and easy to manage billions of events. An event streamer app that concludes all the data into an event streaming process that handles the data continuously.

## Tools of Event Streaming
Apart from the above, one of the toolings that might often be heard about event streaming is apache, Kafka. Apache Kafka provide a quickly scale up and down with minimal downtime and also fault tolerance.
