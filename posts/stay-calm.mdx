## Prologue
Hi folks. It has been a long time since I've ever posted a journal about myself. What I have been through was might be not good for you but just as a reminder, you can read this if you preparing for your mental health and want to know how to handle self-blame and frustration based on my experience.

self-blaming is an act of self-depression after suffering a series of unfortunate events. And the cause can't be denied by one or another person it may be a pure accident or by the cause of any other person.

I've often faced a self-blaming situation almost every day. And after that, I do feel so gloomy but I need to remind myself that I know I can face it. I know there is a better version of me after suffering a bad day.

Word of frustration may come after you have been through a lot of suffering situations.

And the situation of frustration being ended up by self-blaming might be coming from the rejection of social life. Some people feel the way of rejection was simply by judging others or as we called it bullying. And by that, the bullies also gain social status through their actions. Other may look up to them and judge them to be more powerful, cool, or funny. Or even in extreme cases was end up with the fear of their social life. The victim becomes lonely and suffers from their acts of judgment.

## What do I do
We can deny the assumption for how long you can persist and hold on to the feeling of frustration But if you see it clear and embrace what you have now. You should be grateful and blessed with what you have been until now.

Also, you should consider gaining your morale while your drink enough water. Stay breathing and imagine why you should do more positive useful stuff. And if you are Muslim don't forget to pray five times a day. I think it should be enough to cover up your self-blaming and frustration.

## The Blocker

Actually, I'm not the kind of typical person that can handle those situations so easily. Because I feel the frustration could be handled if you accept it first. Why, because you know that the scope of frustration can be really big or small. And you need to be mentally prepared.

## Next Up
I need to refresh myself and make it as a habit.
Create a good habit schedule. 
May be I should take on leave vacation.


## Conclusion
Being grateful and thankful was a key point to scoop your frustrating situation. Self-blame can always be recovered if you stay on with positive thinking

Hope this article can help you better understand based on my experience to handle self-blame. Thank you for reading this article. GBU.
