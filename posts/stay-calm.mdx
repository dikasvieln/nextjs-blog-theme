## Prologue
Hi folks. It has been long time that I've never post a journal about myself. What I've have been through was might be not good to you but just as reminder you can read this if you preparing your mental health and wanting to know how to handle self-blame and frustation based on my experiance. 

self-blaming it is an act of self-depression after suffering a series of unfortunate events. And the cause can't be denied by one or other person it may be purely accident or by the cause of any other person. 

I've often facing the self-blaming situation almost everyday. And after that I do feel so gloomy but I need to remind myself that I know I can face it. 
I know there is better version of me after suffering the bad day.

Word of frustation may came after you have been through a lot of suffering situation. 

And situation of frustation being end up by self-blaming might be came from rejection of social life. Some people feel the way of rejection was simply by judging others or as we called it bullying. And by that, the bullies also gain social status by their action. Other may look up to them and judge them to be more powerful, cool, or funny. Or even in extreme case was end up with fear to their social life. The victim become lonely and suffer with their acts of judge. 

## What do I do
We can deny of the assumption for how long that you can persist and hold on the feel of frustation
But if you see it clear and embracing what you have now. You should be grateful and bless with what you have been until now.

Also you should consider to gain your moral while your drink enough water. Stay breathing and imagine why you should do more positive useful stuff. 
And if you are moslem don't forget to pray five times a day. I think it should be enough to cover up your self-blaming and frustation.


## The Blocker
Actually, I'm not kind of typical person that can handle of a frustation situation so easily. Because I feel that a frustation could be handling if you are accept it first.
Why, because you know that the scope of frustation can be really big or small.
And you need to be mentally prepare.


## Next Up
I need to refresh myself and make it as a habit.
Create a good habit schedule. 
May be I should take on leave vacation.


## Conclusion
Being grateful and thankful was key point to scoop your frustation situation. Self-blame can be always be recovery if you stay on with positive thinking
