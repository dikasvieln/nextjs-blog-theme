## Intro

Let me tell you the background motivation to build this project. My first initiated FE boilerplate project was back on my job at the news office as a web designer. They needed to create a fast and robust microsite every time they got a new advertiser to publish by their media online. And some other way I just need to make it a DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) scheme for any request to build a microsite.

Because I love task automation, my first curiosity was on gulp task runner which is probably the best toolkit that I ever used at least now. But, instead of using the gulp, I do have interest in a grunt that build just right before gulp was released. The grunt may seem not as fast as gulp task runner but the simplicity of the grunt file makes me so want to discover much more about this task automation. And so I end up making that FE Boilerplate on my GitHub repos.
List Description

## List Description
My inspiration for building this boilerplate was from reading an article by a Mozilla developer who create an amazing CSS illustration design with just only one line CSS property. This was an incredible creative beyond my imagination as HTML/CSS developer before I got into my FE stuff. But I did add another grunt package to make it run with the js file too.

Here is the list of package that has been installed on the project:


| Package Name          | Description
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Grunt Contrib Clean   | For clean                                          |
| Grunt Contrib Connect | For to connect with another file                   |
| Grunt Contrib Copy    | For copy the file after watch by stream            |
| Grunt Contrib JSHint  | For use to lint                                    |
