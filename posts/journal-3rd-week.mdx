## Prologue
My daily to-do on the third week of November 2022, was much busier with joining all the BSS projects from clients. either for migration or supporting logs. Both of them definitely need to be more extra focused and energy. Because sometimes I need to stay awake for a long period of the night to stand by if the Client needed support with any BSS log. 

## What do I do
Keeping all the QA testers to meet their requirement sanity test case with support logging data via BE(BackEnd) Middleware apps

## The blocker 
Sometimes I need to reenact or analyze what kind of error response causes the data or test case which does not properly work. Within that, I need to do more creative thinking to solve the problem by asking the other teams.

## Next up
It was probably the last week of November 2022, when we were going to prepare the next step of migration programs from the client side.

## conlusion
I hope to get more understanding and communication for the whole problem that might occur in the sanity testing. Thank you for reading my Journal at Aleph-Labs. If there is any grammar or sentences that might not quite good please comment below.
