## Prologue
My daily todo on third week of november 2022, was much busier with joining all the BSS project from client. either is for migration and supporting log. Both of them was definitely need to be more extra focus and enegy. Because sometime I need to stay awake for a long period of night to stand by if the Client needed to support any BSS log. 

## What do I do
Keeping all the QA tester to meet their requirement sanity test case with support logging data via BE(BackEnd) Middleware apps 

## The blocker 
Sometime I need to reenact or analyzing what kind of error response that cause the data or test case that not properly working. Within that I need to do more creative thinking to solve the problem with asking 
the other teams.

## Next up
It probably the last week of November 2022, was going to preparing the next step of migration programs from the client side.

## conlusion
I hope to get more understanding and communicative for the whole problem that might be occured in the sanity testing.
