## Prologue
For the last two weeks in November 2022, I do kind of ops stuff with support on BSS Migration team which is the task are seeking and finding for any error response or log data in myXL Apps. I often to be asked for join BSS testing meet for any requests logs that they need to offer.


## What do I do
As far I concern If I'm not wrong, The BSS itself was focus on changing their endpoint pointing  especially gateway url on their SOA part. My part wasn't too big afterall because what I do was coordinate with their myXL BSS tester and especially for any cases TC that they need to accomplish.

## The Blocker
As far as I support the BSS team for any test cases. And there isn't any blocker on our teams of MW BE but even though there is always comes up with the solution. 

## Next Up
Monitoring and supporting any misbehaviour or error response with finding and seeking any log error response based on their test cases.


## Conclusion
Overall as far as I follow up the BSS mig it will be impacted on big future plan of myXL. And Hope get gain any insight and get more knowledge about service architecture oriented flow.
