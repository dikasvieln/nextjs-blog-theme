As part of Developer Operation(Devops) tools, one of common tools that used for testing on local environment is Docker. And CNCF(Cloud Native Computing Foundation) commited that Docker was an open source community that provide many developer to contribute as open PR

## Docker

The based core of Docker was built with golang programming language. And there is many feature that you can use, one of a new feature was Docker Kubernetes.
You can find these feature if you are installing docker desktop in version 1.20+. 

By the way Docker provide the abilit to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called container. The isolation and security allows you to run many container simultaneously on a given host.

Kubernetes or as we called in shortname was k8s. It was an open source tools that use for orchetrating the container for auto-scaling and management of containerized application. K8s was abbreviation from Kubernetes.

## Minikube 
It's was called an alternative k8s in local engine. Focusing on making it easy to learn and develop for k8s. Here is below some image
