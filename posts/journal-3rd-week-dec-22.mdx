On the third week of December 2022, there was discussion about the documentation and kafka C1 from the client. And will be on reply after next year.

## What do I do
Doing the revision and adding new sequence diagrams

## The Blocker
I think there is no blocker up until the documentation have done send to the client.

## The Next
Wait for any changes or updates from the client side either the kafka C1, MCCM or the listener apps. 

## Conclusion
For further due, I'll be keep updating the documentation for C1 kafka and improve my hard skill as FE dev. Thank you for reading my journal blog. GBU
