title: CDK8s for cloud kit development 
description: An Alternative ways to build your manifest yaml file

Hello folks, we will further discuss an alternative way to deploy your final apps into an instance of a cloud server by using the k8s cluster engine. But instead, you are using your YAML manifest file, you will build your custom YAML file by using an SDK third party. One thing that you might find about CDK8s is a software development kit framework for defining K8s apps and reusable abstractions using familiar programming languages and rich object-oriented APIs.

CDK8s was supposed to make sure your deployment manifest file is valid, reusable, and easy to maintain. With support from 4 languages which is python, typescript, java, and rust, you should be able to build your custom template YAML file the same as you are developing your apps from the beginning.

## How to works
Based on generated file, the root of the trees is a Constructor named _App_. Within the App, you can define any number of charts( Classes that extend the _Chart_ class). Each chart synthesized a separated K8s manifest file and eventually represent any K8s resource, such as Pod, Service, Deployment, and ReplicaSet. 

## Example 

Based on how cdk8s can work for any cluster and makes an imperative approach to the declarative state as a developer you can probably enjoy the expressiveness of simplicity of imperative programming.

Here is below how to define k8s from the cdk8s script.

```
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { App, Chart, ChartProps } from 'cdk8s';
import {IntOrString, KubeDeployment, KubeService} from './imports/k8s';

export class CovYaml extends Chart {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: ChartProps = { }) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const label = { app: 'cov-app' }
    // define resources here

    new KubeService(this, 'service', {
      spec: {
        type: 'ClusterIP',
        ports: [ { port: 3000, targetPort: IntOrString.fromNumber(3000) } ],
        selector: label
      }
    });

    new KubeDeployment(this, 'deployment', {
      spec: {
        replicas: 2,
        selector: {
          matchLabels: label
        },
        template: {
          metadata: { labels : label},
          spec: {
            containers: [
              {
                name: 'cov-app',
                image: 'cov-app:1.0.0',
                imagePullPolicy: 'Never',
                ports: [ { containerPort: 3000 } ],
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    })

  }
}

const app = new App();
new CovYaml(app, 'cov');
app.synth();
```

After building your own custom scripts, it should generate the YAML file like these below.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: cov-service-c87c1d6b
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000
  selector:
    app: cov-app
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cov-deployment-c80cb48c
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: cov-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: cov-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: cov-app:1.0.0
          imagePullPolicy: Never
          name: cov-app
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
```

And you can apply it from the dist folder after the build has been done.
the service and deployment should be created after that.

```
kubeclt apply -f dist/cov.k8s.yaml
service/cov-service-23e79b52 created
deployment.apps/cov-deployment-8b2b7b76 created
```

# Conclusion

I hope from this article you should sense the potential of an imperative way to build a YAML file using one of the AWS open source projects. To find more detail on how to use cdk8s deeper such as abstraction layers or high-level Construct library, you can follow the link from the source below.

If there is any recommendation about the paper or any project that comes with cdk8s, I would be glad and love to support your project. And last but not least thank you for reading my article. GBU
