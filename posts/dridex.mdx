## Prologue
Hi fellow cyber fans, This time in my latest post will discuss Dridex. One of the vulnerability viruses that can attack your pc system was a trending issue in 2015 back then.

## Behind the Story
Dridex was first identified in November 2014 as the new and improved Cridex Trojan, but with added features such as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functions and wider attack capabilities, targeting more than just banking services. The malware runs over Microsoft Windows financial institutions in over 40 countries(O'Brien 2016). It runs over Microsoft Windows injecting through HTML and is mainly disseminated through spammed phishing campaigns with embedded links or attachments that house the malicious software. The email can be general or tailored to suit the victim's work environment(such as a member working in the financial sector) and prompt the user to download a Word document or Excel spreadsheet labeled, e.g. invoice bank statement or payroll. 
Once the user opened the file that contains the malware, it can inject itself into internet explorer, chrome, and firefox whenever they are deployed. It then waits for the user to log into one of the 300 configured websites and capture credentials by logging keystrokes., taking screenshots, stealing cookies, or capturing data input which is then transmitted back to the criminal control.

## History
In 2015, a Moldovan man however was arrested in Cyprus as a result of a large-scale takedown operation conducted by UK and US officials. The man was accused of being a key figure responsible for developing and deploying Dridex operations in Europe and officials were able to redirect infected computers away from command-and-control servers.
During the month between 1st November 2015 and 15th, January 2016 Symantec teams identified and logged 145 Dridex spam campaigns and noted a number of interesting characteristics. In almost 75 percent of cases, the attackers use legitimate company names and top-level domains to match the affected area such as "co.uk" or "com.au" Anywhere from one to eight campaigns were deployed in a day on which Symantec was able to block an average of 271,019 emails per campaign with the largest being 982,832 emails during a particularly large attack. 

Based on cases, The primary target of Dridex is the physical workstation rather than company networks and servers. It is not designed to run on VM ware or in sandbox environments making it harder for researchers to detect and understand its behavior. 

And for the next one will discuss the story of how we prevent the Dridex operations. If there's any grammar that you might found not correctly or any sentences that are quite right. You can reach me via [email](mailto:aulia.mahardika@live.com). Thank you for reading my blog. GBU.
