## Prologue
Hi fellow cyber fans, This time on my latest post will discuss about Dridex. One of vulnerability virus that can attack on your pc system and it was trend issues at 2015 back then.

## Behind the Story
Dridex was first identified in November 2014 as the new and improved Cridex Trojan, but with added features such as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functions and wider attack capabilities, targeting more than just banking service. The malware runs over Microsoft Windows financial institutions in over 40 countries(O'Brien 2016). It runs over Microsoft Windows injecting through HTML and is mainly disseminated through spammed phishing campaigns with embedded links or attachments that house themalicious software. The email can be general or tailored to suit the victim work environment(such as member working in the financial sector) and prompt user to download Word document or Excel spreadsheet labelled, e.g. invoice, bank statement or payroll. 
Once user opened the file that containt those malware, it can injet itself into internet explorer, chrome and firefox whenever they are deployed. It then waits for the user to log into one of the 300 configured websites and capture credentials by loggin key strokes., taking screenshot, stealing cookies or capturing data input which is then transmitted back to the criminal control.

## History
In 2015, moldovan man however was arrested in Cyprus as a reslut of largescale takedonw orperatioon conducted by UK and US officials. The man was accused of being a key figure respolnsible for developing and deploying Dridex operations in Europe and officials were able to redirect infected computers away from command-and-control servers.
During the month between 1st November 2015 and 15th January 2016 symantec teams identified and logged 145 Dridex spam campaigns and noted a number of interesting characteristic. In almost 75 percent of cases, the attackers use legitimate company names and top level domains to match the affected area such as "co.uk" or "com.au" Anywhere from one to eight campaigns were deployed in a day of which Symantec was able to block an average of 271,019 emails per campaign with the larges being 982,832 emails during a particularrly large attack. 


Based on cases, The primary target of Dridex is the physical workstation rather thant company networks and servers. It is not designer to run on VM ware or in sandbox environments making it harder for researcher to detect and understant its behaviour. 

And for the next one will be discuss behind the story of how that we prevent the Dridex operations. If theres any grammar that you might found not correctly or any sentences that quite right. You can reach me via [email](mailto:aulia.mahardika@live.com). Thank you for read my blog. GBU.
