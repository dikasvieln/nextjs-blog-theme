Hi folks, continuing from the part I of Drydex operation. This article will further discuss about the side effect aftermath and how to prevent the attack from the malicious malware.

The malware operates using the malware-as-a-service model which provides both the pre-built malware kit and event customer serivce support. As the provider got exists the primary target is the physical workstation rather than company networks and servers. It's not designed to run on VMware or in any sandbox environment making it harder for researchers to detect and understand its behavior. And perhaps it will enables armature cybercriminals to use the pre-designed cyberattack tools and deploy campaigns with little to no knowledge of how the technicalities work.

In 2015, researchers from the Royal Holloway University of London along with SANS institute and CISCO analyzed and recorded a packet capture(PCAP) file of Dridex activity. Both teams highlighted a number of interesting characteristics and behaviours that the malware demonstrated during the tests. The test in questions were run through programs such as Tcpick, Wireshark, and Tshark and which were then cross referenced in order to identify any trends and patterns. Along with many other findings researchers noted that the infected computer communicated with the targeted IP addresses at the same rate as legitimate traffic traveling alongside it. 

As of 2016 the alleged organised gang behind the malware development, such as Evil Corp, have not only updated the Trojan further but seem to have paired up with Cerber ransomware products. US security company FireEye released a blog during May 2016 outlining the major developments that the cybercriminals have adopted this year. There has been a significant increase in the Word and Excel-based spam campaigns however the payloads being delivered are now Cerber ransomware.

The first step for organisations to hep prevent and protect against Dridex attacks is to invest time and funding into the education and training of their employees. Teaching individuals to recognize and react to security threats accordingly is the firs and most effective method for avoiding a data breach ad mainting the confidentiality, integrity and availibility (CIA) of an organisation's networks and services. 

The alternative way of defence against Dridex and similar malware is utilising IDS to monitor company networks, servers and users actions for evidence of policy violations and malicious activity. Once infected early detection is the next best outcome for organisation. Network and host-based IDS (HIDS) applications are effective tools that minimise the collateral damagee that a data breach may cause. 

Lastly, in any IT environment the human factor is always the weakest security link with in a network, therefore it is vital that organisations adopt and enforce strict and comprehensive cyber security policies that detail best practices and duties. These best practices consider everything from adopting appropriate physical security standards to implementing access controls, social media policies and incident response plans. And always keep changing your account social media password at least every 3 months, it may come from social engineering tactics that can be used potentiality of spear phishing email and tailored to the individuals interest or line of work. 

If there is any grammar or sentences that may incorrect to you. Please kindly to inform me via [email](mailto:aulia.mahardika@live.com). And if may there is misinformed about the dridex you may suggest me or fill in the comment below. Thank you for reading my blog, see you in the next blog which we discussed about cdk8s (cloud kit development) by AWS. GBU.
